Understanding Mortality Trends: A Data-Driven Approach to Public Health Insights 

### 📊 WHO Mortality Database Analysis (2021–Present)

## Project Overview
Mortality trends vary significantly by **age**, **sex**, and **geographic region**, influencing how public health resources must be planned and distributed. In this project, I analyze global mortality records from the **WHO Mortality Database (Morticd10_part6)** — containing **369,240 records** with ICD-10 coded causes of death from **2021 onward**.

Objective:

✔ Predict leading causes of death  
✔ Identify regional mortality clusters  
✔ Forecast future mortality trends  
✔ Support data-driven public health decisions  

---

## Problem Statement
Public health planning requires a strong understanding of **who is dying, where, and why**. However, regional mortality variations often remain unclear. This project addresses that through:

✔ ML-based predictive modeling  
✔ Clustering to identify similar population mortality patterns  
✔ Time-series forecasting for future risk evaluation

## 💡 Impact & Public Health Value
- Enables earlier **intervention in high-risk regions**
- Assists in **resource allocation and budgeting**
- Provides **data-driven forecasting** for future preparedness
- Strengthens **comparative health insights** across countries
